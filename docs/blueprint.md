# **App Name**: GEP Paragliding

## Core Features:

- Navigation Bar: Implement a responsive navigation bar with menu items: Home, About, Courses, Gallery, Testimonials, Blog, FAQ, Contact, and a 'Book Now' button.
- Contact Form: Design a contact form with fields for name, email, and message, directly embedding the contact information (address, phone number, email) from the reference site within the contact page for user convenience.
- Landing Page: Create a landing page that uses smooth scrolling.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL 200, 70%, 50%, RGB hex #3db5e8. This bright blue conveys trust, professionalism, and stability, referencing the safety and adventure of paragliding.
- Background color: HSL 200, 20%, 95%, RGB hex #f0f8fa. A light, desaturated version of the primary, keeping a soft reference to adventure in the background without overpowering other content.
- Accent color: HSL 170, 50%, 40%, RGB hex #34a582. A teal color, 30 degrees 'left' of blue on the color wheel, gives a contrast in brightness and saturation.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text.
- Use a set of modern line icons throughout the site to visually represent each section in a clean manner.
- Implement a clean, grid-based layout that allows content to be easily consumed on any device.
- Use subtle fade-in animations as the user scrolls down the page to keep the site dynamic.
